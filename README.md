# num-rand-game

## Main idea: 
This is a mini-game where the user should give the correct answer and recognize which math expression is bigger. I created three levels of difficulty: 
- on the first one only numbers are compared 
- on the second level there is an arithmetic expression
- on the third one there are roots and powers of numbers. 
I have also added a rating, which is saved even after leaving the application, for this I have used the Core Data Framework to save this data to the phone's memory.

## Language and Technology: 
- SWIFT 
- CoreData

### DONE: 
- Main screen
- Set up difficulty screen
- Game screen and all expressions

## TO DO:
- ///
